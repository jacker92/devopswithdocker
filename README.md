# DevOps with Docker

This repository contains tasks made for course [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/). 

Tasks are logically divided into different directories. Only the required files are included in the repo (for example, the *Dockerfile*), so all of the directories do not contain executable applications.
